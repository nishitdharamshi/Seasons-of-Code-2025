## Decentralized Certificate Verification System
This repository documents my journey as i build a decentralized certificate verification system using blockchain technology. I am using this project to learn the fundamentals of blockchain development. I will be sharing what I learn in this README file.

**Blockchain:** A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, immutable ledger or database that records transactions across a network of computers. We can think of it as a public spreadsheet that everyone can see, but no one can edit retroactively. Each entry (called a block) is linked (chained) to the previous one using cryptographic hashes.

**Decentralization:** Decentralization refers to systems where no single person or organization (such as the government) has complete control.
