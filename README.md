## Decentralized Certificate Verification System
This repository documents my journey as i build a decentralized certificate verification system using blockchain technology. I am using this project to learn the fundamentals of blockchain development. I will be sharing what I learn in this README file.

**Blockchain:** A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, immutable ledger or database that records transactions across a network of computers. We can think of it as a public spreadsheet that everyone can see, but no one can edit retroactively. Each entry (called a block) is linked (chained) to the previous one using cryptographic hashes.

**Decentralization:** Decentralization refers to systems where no single person or organization (such as the government) has complete control.

**Digital Signatures:** A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that allows someone to prove the authenticity and integrity of a digital message, file, or transaction; like a virtual fingerprint.

**Cryptographic Hash Functions:** A cryptographic hash function is a special kind of function that takes any input (a file, message, certificate, etc.) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, usually called a hash. It can be thought of as a digtial fingerprint of data.

**Proof of Work:** Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks (like Bitcoin) to agree on the state of the blockchain without needing a central authority. It requires network participants (called miners) to solve a difficult mathematical puzzle in order to find a random number (called a nonce) that, when hashed with the block data, produces a hash with a required number of leading zeros. The first miner to find a valid hash wins, broadcasts it, and adds the new block to the blockchain.

**Transaction fees:** Transaction fees are small amounts of cryptocurrency paid by users to get their transactions processed and confirmed by the network. In many blockchains, fees are part of the reward system for securing the network.
